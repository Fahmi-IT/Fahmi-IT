- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fahmi-IT
- 👀 I’m interested in Computers, Logic, Games, and Collaborative Activities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java in my 1st year of university. However, I also have experience in HTML, Javascript, C++, and Python (though I may need a little bit of review)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on just about anything. Anything that is challenging. Cause that's fun.
- 📫 You can reach me at (613) 220 1692 (please leave a voice message) or at sajidfahmi03@gmail.com.
